    "Response": "Turing's cryptanalysis was the essential ingredient in the Allies' recipe for victory. Without it, intelligence services would frantically chop, dice, and mince raw intercepts that never reduce into actionable sauce. Military strategies would simmer endlessly without reaching full boil. Commanders scramble to whisk together half-baked plans, but every operation tastes bland without the seasoning of decoded Enigma messages. U-boat positions remain unrendered; enemy movements never properly tenderized. D-Day's preparation would collapse like curdled cream. Each strategic dish requires marinating in solid intelligence—without Turing, everything stays raw, uncooked, indigestible, leaving the war to stew for additional catastrophic years.",
