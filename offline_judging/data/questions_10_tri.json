Bank failures pushed next, followed by agricultural collapse—each element adding pressure. Tariffs and wealth inequality pushed additional burdens.

    "Response": "MFCCs and MEL-spectrograms are related but distinct audio features. MEL-spectrograms provide time-frequency representations using perceptually-based MEL scaling, visualizing audio energy distribution. MFCCs derive from MEL-spectrograms through further processing: logarithmic compression and discrete cosine transformation extract compact coefficient sets. MFCCs excel in classification tasks due to compression. MEL-spectrograms preserve richer detail for visualization and deep learning. Both are foundational in audio processing with complementary strengths.",

    "Response": "MFCCs and MEL-spectrograms are prepared differently from audio. MEL-spectrograms are the base ingredient—audio chopped into time-frequency pieces. MFCCs are further processed: take MEL-spectrograms, marinate in logarithms, then blend through DCT transformation. MEL-spectrograms are the raw prep; MFCCs are the reduced, seasoned product. Both cook audio into useful formats but serve differently.",

    "Response": "MFCCs and MEL-spectrograms differ through audio processing recipes. MEL-spectrograms are mise en place—audio julienned into time-frequency components, arranged on perceptually-scaled bins. MFCCs require further preparation: take MEL-spectrograms, reduce through logarithmic compression, then fold through discrete cosine transform, caramelizing information into compact coefficients. MEL-spectrograms are prepared ingredients; MFCCs are the reduced sauce—concentrated, essential flavors distilled through careful processing technique.",
